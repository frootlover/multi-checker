# multi-checker
Web deployed tool to check multiple platforms for a usernames availability. 
You can request websites or features by creating an issue under "request"

You can deploy this on your own to vercel, but you will have to generate your own bearer token. You can find more information [here](https://docs.x.com/resources/fundamentals/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens).

no im not adding tiktok or instagram. there's no public endpoint for either of those. you can request something like snapchat, i'm already adding it. but something like that. RESEARCH IT FIRST. MAKE SURE IT HAS A PUBLIC API

This tool isn't finished, so there is no vercel app yet. You'll have to upload all the files yourself.
